      <p>Levi Ackerman is the tritagonist of the Attack on Titan anime/manga
      series. He is a captain in the Survey Corps, known to be the strongest
      soldier alive. He has a harsh and unsocial personality, but is
      well-regarded by his subordinates and he cares about their lives.</p>

      <p>Zenitsu had to become a demon slayer because he was tricked. Apparently,
      a woman tricked Zenitsu into taking on a large amount of debt, and a demon
       slayer-trainer took over the debt. Zenitsu was forced to train as a
       consequence of his debt being taken over.</p>
